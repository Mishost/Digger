# Digger
A FMI Project for the Data Structures and Algorithms course released with the help of SDL2

## The Concept
The game consists of the player running around the screen, trying to avoid the enemies. The hero can dig new paths and go wherever. Whereas, the enemies can go through tunnels or create new paths, but slower. The algorithm used for path-finding is quite similar to Best-First Search. 

There is a money bag, which if taken by an enemy, will make it stronger and change its appearance. On the other hand, if the player tries to take it, he will die. The moral of the game is not to be cruel. 

You win the game when there are no paths left to be dug.
